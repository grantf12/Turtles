            Turtles are like the dogs of the sea, they are freindly and everyone wants to go up the them and pet them. They eat mostly plants but some species even eat jelly fish!

            There are a lot of different turtle species but some of them are indangered due to some people liking turtles a little too much and will kill them for their shells, while a lot of other turtles mistake trash in the ocean for food and it can end up killing them.
